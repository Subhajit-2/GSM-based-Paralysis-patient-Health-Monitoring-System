# GSM-based-Paralysis-patient-Health-Monitoring-System
The GSM Based Paralysis Patient Health Monitoring System is an embedded-system–based healthcare solution designed to continuously monitor vital health parameters of paralysis patients and automatically alert caregivers in emergency situations. The system addresses the communication and mobility challenges faced by paralysis patients by providing real-time health monitoring, local display, and remote SMS alerts using GSM technology.

🎯 Project Objectives : Continuous monitoring of vital health parameters:
    Body temperature,
    Heart rate (ECG),
    Limb movement,
    Automatic SMS alerts during medical emergencies,
    Remote accessibility for caregivers and family members,
    Reduced dependency on frequent hospital visits &
    Improved patient safety and quality of life.

🛠️ Hardware & Technologies Used :
    Arduino Mega 2560 – Central processing unit,
    LM35 Temperature Sensor – Body temperature monitoring,
    ECG Sensor – Heart rate and cardiac activity monitoring,
    Flex Sensor – Limb movement detection,
    SIM900 GSM/GPRS Module – SMS-based communication and alerts,
    16×2 LCD Display – Real-time local health data display & 
    Embedded C / Arduino IDE – Firmware development.

🔄 System Working Principle
Data Acquisition : Sensors continuously capture temperature, heart rate, and limb movement data from the patient.
Data Processing : The Arduino Mega processes sensor data and compares it against predefined safety thresholds.
Local Display : Real-time health parameters are displayed on a 16×2 LCD for nearby caregivers.
Emergency Alert System : If abnormal readings are detected (high temperature, irregular heart rate, or no limb movement), the system sends an SMS alert via the GSM module to pre-registered mobile numbers.
Remote Monitoring : Caregivers receive alerts even when they are not physically present, enabling timely medical intervention.

✨ Key Features
    Real-time health monitoring,
    Automatic emergency SMS alerts,
    Low-cost and portable design,
    Operates in areas without internet connectivity,
    Easy to use and maintain &
    Suitable for home-based and rural healthcare environments.
